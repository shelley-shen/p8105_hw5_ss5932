## Problem 1

Read in the data.

``` r
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("homicide_data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_"),
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest"        ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest"      ~ "solved",
    )
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

    ## Parsed with column specification:
    ## cols(
    ##   uid = col_character(),
    ##   reported_date = col_double(),
    ##   victim_last = col_character(),
    ##   victim_first = col_character(),
    ##   victim_race = col_character(),
    ##   victim_age = col_character(),
    ##   victim_sex = col_character(),
    ##   city = col_character(),
    ##   state = col_character(),
    ##   lat = col_double(),
    ##   lon = col_double(),
    ##   disposition = col_character()
    ## )

Create an aggregate DF

``` r
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
  group_by(city_state) %>% 
  summarize(
    hom_total = n(),
    hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
  )
```

    ## `summarise()` ungrouping output (override with `.groups` argument)

Proportion test for a single city

``` r
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved), 
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)) %>% 
  broom::tidy()
```

    ## # A tibble: 1 x 8
    ##   estimate statistic  p.value parameter conf.low conf.high method    alternative
    ##      <dbl>     <dbl>    <dbl>     <int>    <dbl>     <dbl> <chr>     <chr>      
    ## 1    0.646      239. 6.46e-54         1    0.628     0.663 1-sample~ two.sided

Iterate for all cities

``` r
results_df = 
  aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_tests = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_tests = map(.x = prop_tests, ~broom::tidy(.x))
  ) %>% 
  select(-prop_tests) %>% 
  unnest(tidy_tests) %>% 
  select(city_state, estimate, conf.low, conf.high)
```

``` r
results_df %>% 
  mutate(city_state = fct_reorder(city_state, estimate)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = city_state, y = estimate)) +
  geom_point() + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = conf.low, ymax = conf.high)) + 
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90, vjust = 0.5, hjust = 1))
```

## Problem 2

Read in data and create dataframe.

``` r
path_df = 
  tibble(
    path = list.files("lda_data")) %>% 
  mutate(
    path = str_c("lda_data/", path),
    data = map(.x = path, ~read_csv(.x))) %>% 
  unnest(data)
```

Tidy the data.

``` r
path_tidy =
  path_df %>% 
  separate(path, into = c("folder", "arm"), sep = 9) %>% 
  separate(arm, into = c("arm", "id"), sep = "_") %>% 
  separate(id, into = c("id", "file"), sep = 2) %>% 
  select(-folder, -file) %>% 
  mutate(
    id = str_remove(id, "0")) %>% 
  pivot_longer(
    week_1:week_8,
    names_to = "week",
    values_to = "value",
    names_prefix = "week_")
```

Create a spaghetti plot showing observations on each subject over time.

``` r
lda_plot = 
  path_tidy %>% 
  group_by(arm, id) %>% 
  ggplot(
    aes(x = week, y = value, group = id, color = id)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  facet_grid(arm ~.) +
  labs(
    title = "Observations for control vs. experimental arms over time",
    x = "Week of Observation",
    y = "Values"
  )
```

From the spaghetti plot, we see that generally, the experimental group
had higher observation values than the control group. While the
experimental group observations increased over time, the control group
remained consistent without any significant changes overall. The
consistency of the control arm is reasonable as it did not receive any
treatment, and any change within the control is likely due to a placebo
effect.
